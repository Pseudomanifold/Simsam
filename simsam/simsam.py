    This is a naive sampling procedure that will not result in
    samples being drawn uniformly from the n-simplex. However,
    it is fast and might be suitable as a baseline algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Dimension of simplex to sample from.
    N : int
        Number of points to sample.

    Returns
    -------
    `np.array` of shape (N, n), with the rows corresponding to
    individual samples.

    """Sample from an n-dimensional simplex using Kraemer's algorithm.

    This is the preferred algorithm for sampling uniformly from the unit
    n-simplex. Following Smith & Tromble _[1] the sampling procedure was
    updated to ensure that the sampling is uniform across distributions,
    provided they have full support. This behaviour can be changed using
    the `full_support` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Dimension of simplex to sample from.
    N : int
        Number of points to sample.
    full_support : bool
        If set, only provides distributions with full support, i.e. with
        non-zero values only. Typically, this parameter does not have to
        be changed---the differences are minuscule.

    Returns
    -------
    `np.array` of shape (N, n), with the rows corresponding to
    individual samples.
